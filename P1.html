                        <h2 id="project-idea">Project Idea</h2>
                        <p>
                            Our project idea is a user-friendly grocery management app aimed towards individuals with special dietary needs or restrictions. These users may include individuals with Diabetes, Celiac Disease, or those on special diets such as Vegan or Keto. The app will contain all the functionalities expected from a grocery management app such as the ability to select and enter grocery items, adjust quantities, track expiration dates and sync with other household members’ app. However, as mentioned above, our app will have a large focus on food items as our goal is to provide an effective way for users with dietary restrictions to plan, track and shop for groceries.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Furthermore, another functionality our app will have is a section where there will be recipe suggestions based on the current food items present at home. These recommended recipes will take into account the medical conditions and special diets which the user has identified and will suggest recipes popular with those who share those dietary restrictions. We expect the users of our app to be actively involved in refining the recommendations the app provides by using the “thumbs up” or “thumbs down” feature to indicate whether they would like to see more of this item or not. This ensure that the suggestions provided to the user are finely tuned to the specific needs and preferences of that user. A key part of these recommendations will be replacement items for a specified product which serves as alternatives that conform to the dietary restriction identified by the user. For example, if a user follows a vegan diet then searching for milk will result in suggestions for almond milk and soy milk as a replacement so that users can look for these items the next time they shop. We will combine all the user generated data with data from popular food and health websites to enable the app to provide accurate recommendations for specific food items and recipes which are popular with individuals with the same dietary restrictions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lastly, our app will also have the capability to link and partner with various grocery stores. We will be obtaining the ingredients and nutrition facts from the information provided on the USDA’s National Nutrient Database. All of this collected data will be used to support customized restrictions set by the users and the app will send an alert if any item contains a restricted ingredient. Future functionalities of the app may include the ability to order groceries from the participating stores directly from the mobile app.
                        </p>
                        <h2 id="users">Users</h2>
                        <p>
                            Our app can be used by any individual who needs an efficient grocery management app, however, our main user base will consist of teens and adults who have a specific medical condition or follow a special diet. This app is a tool designed to help these individuals who have dietary restrictions to effectively manage their groceries as well as plan, track and shop for grocery items that take into account the user’s special diet and personal food preferences. No special training or experience would be required to use this app as it would operate like other similar grocery management apps and will be intuitive to use as well as user-friendly.

                        <h2 id="stakeholders">Stakeholders</h2>
                        <p>
                            Our users are the main stakeholders, however, some other stakeholders may include doctors, nutritionists and dieticians who might want to suggest our app as a tool to help their patients and clients.
                        </p>
                        <h2 id="user-research">User Research Methods</h2>
                        <p>
                            For our project we chose the Secondary Research and the Persona IDEO methods. These methods complement each other because the Secondary Research helps inform our choice of Personas. By doing Secondary Research we can determine the different types of food restrictions our users may follow. We can also better understand the popularity of different food restrictions and the demographics of a typical user following that food restriction.

                        <p>For people who have certain diseases, they must keep an eye on specific food since certain food might be risky to their lives. This includes people having food allergies and other healthy issues such as heart disease, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood lipid, asthma, diabetic and etc. </p>
                        <h5>Food Allergies</h5>
                        <p>The most common individual food allergies include those to peanuts, tree nuts (walnuts, pecans etc), fish, shellfish, eggs, milk, soy, corn and wheat. </p>
                        <h5>Diabetics</h5>
                        <p>For people who have diabetics, Insulin is needed to help cells take in the glucose. They need to pay special attention on the intake of carbohydrate-containing foods. A planned diabetic diet should help to schedule carbohydrate intake so that the cells can get the glucose that they need, as well as, focus on keeping balance of carbohydrates, protein and fat, along with vitamins, minerals, fiber and other nutrients. </p>
                        <h5>High Blood Pressure</h5>
                        <p>Avoid salted packaged foods, prevent taking in excessive sugar, reduce items high in saturated fats. People with high blood pressure can replace animal, saturated, and trans fats with plant fats. Eating high-fiber foods such as nuts, beans, and whole grains is also helpful.</p>
                        <h4 id="religious-aspect">Religious Aspect<sup><a href="#cit-4">[4]</a></sup></h4>
                        <p>There are many different types of religious dietary laws. We have included a summary of what we determined to be the most applicable religious based diets to be included in our application. These were chosen based on their popularity and the uniquness of these diets.</p>
                        <h5>Hinduism</h5>
                        <p>A lacto vegetarian diet is followed by many Hindus – no meat, poultry or fish, no eggs, but milk products are allowed and encouraged. Beef is prohibited. Brahmins may have restrictions on who prepares their food and how it is stored. There are many fasting days and periods in the calendar, with restrictions such as eating only plant foods.</p>
                        <h5>Islam</h5>
                        <p>Meats should be slaughtered under Halal guidance; pork is not allowed.  Alcohol is also banned under Halal. During Ramadan, there comes more guidelines for fasting. </p>
                        <h5>Judaism/Kosher</h5>
                        <p>This extremely complex set of guidelines includes restrictions on how meat is slaughtered, which animals/birds/seafood may be eaten (most famously pork and shellfish are not allowed), the part of the animal that can be eaten, who makes certain foods, combinations of foods, avoiding contamination, what can be eaten on religious holidays, and more.

                        <p>"Ethical eating or food ethics refers to the moral consequences of food choices, both those made by humans for themselves and those made for food animals. Common concerns are damage to the environment, exploitative labor practices, food shortages for others, inhumane treatment of food animals, and the unintended effects of food policy. "  -- Wikipedia<sup><a href="#cit-5">[5]</a></sup>. They are calling consumers for making informed choices about the foods they buy and avoid foods derived from animals abused on farms, unsustainable farming practices or unfair working conditions. Their main concerns focus on animal welfare, the environment and workers' rights. </p>
                        <p>Plants are widely favoured. Preferences are nuts, grains, legumes, vegetables, and fruits. However, being as an ethical eating person, you  are not necessarily to be vegan, intake of meat is still okay, just look for meat that is sustainable and responsible. Always look for good source of food, choose food with brand guarantee. And when eat outside, choose restaurant that has impeccable reputation can be more rest assured.<sup><a href="#cit-6">[6]</a></sup></p>

                        <p>Doing secondary research required a large amount of work. We found there was a lot of information available so choosing a direction and narrowing down the scope was the first tough task we faced. After gathering all the information we needed from credible sources, we needed to refine the content to make it more readable so it can be used as our knowledge base for future development. Overall, the process of secondary research helped us to enhance our understanding of the topic as well as the users and their requirements for our app.</p>

                        <p>Creating the personas for our app was a fairly easy task. This is because it is complemented well with the secondary research from which we discovered various categories of dietary restrictions and what they entail. Using this information we could easily recognize several user categories which helped us shape our final five personas. These personas helped us visualize and characterize real-life potential users who will be using our app and allowed us to ensure that our app’s functionality serves all of these users. The one downside to using personas is that it may not reflect all potential users or all the needs of those users because we are creating these personas from our own research and understanding without actually talking to any real individuals.</p>
