                        <p>
                            Our project idea is a user-friendly grocery management app aimed towards individuals with special dietary needs or restrictions. These users may include individuals with Diabetes, Celiac Disease, or those on special diets such as Vegan or Keto. The app will contain all the functionalities expected from a grocery management app such as the ability to select and enter grocery items, adjust quantities, track expiration dates and sync with other household members’ app. However, as mentioned above, our app will have a large focus on food items as our goal is to provide an effective way for users with dietary restrictions to plan, track and shop for groceries.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Furthermore, another functionality our app will have is a section where there will be recipe suggestions based on the current food items present at home. These recommended recipes will take into account the medical conditions and special diets which the user has identified and will suggest recipes popular with those who share those dietary restrictions. We expect the users of our app to be actively involved in refining the recommendations the app provides by using the “thumbs up” or “thumbs down” feature to indicate whether they would like to see more of this item or not. This ensure that the suggestions provided to the user are finely tuned to the specific needs and preferences of that user. A key part of these recommendations will be replacement items for a specified product which serves as alternatives that conform to the dietary restriction identified by the user. For example, if a user follows a vegan diet then searching for milk will result in suggestions for almond milk and soy milk as a replacement so that users can look for these items the next time they shop. We will combine all the user generated data with data from popular food and health websites to enable the app to provide accurate recommendations for specific food items and recipes which are popular with individuals with the same dietary restrictions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lastly, our app will also have the capability to link and partner with various grocery stores. We will be obtaining the ingredients and nutrition facts from the information provided on the USDA’s National Nutrient Database. All of this collected data will be used to support customized restrictions set by the users and the app will send an alert if any item contains a restricted ingredient. Future functionalities of the app may include the ability to order groceries from the participating stores directly from the mobile app.

                        <p>
                            Our app can be used by any individual who needs an efficient grocery management app, however, our main user base will consist of teens and adults who have a specific medical condition or follow a special diet. This app is a tool designed to help these individuals who have dietary restrictions to effectively manage their groceries as well as plan, track and shop for grocery items that take into account the user’s special diet and personal food preferences. No special training or experience would be required to use this app as it would operate like other similar grocery management apps and will be intuitive to use as well as user-friendly.

                            Our users are the main stakeholders, however, some other stakeholders may include doctors, nutritionists and dieticians who might want to suggest our app as a tool to help their patients and clients.

                        <p>
                            For our project we chose the Secondary Research and the Persona IDEO methods. These methods complement each other because the Secondary Research helps inform our choice of Personas. By doing Secondary Research we can determine the different types of food restrictions our users may follow. We can also better understand the popularity of different food restrictions and the demographics of a typical user following that food restriction.
